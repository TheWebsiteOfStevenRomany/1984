    <p>This is my own webpage and i lunched it under the name of 1984 which is a novil by the gareat writer Goarge Orwill, George Orwell’s visionary and disturbing novel, 1984, establishes a haunting setting: the
        near future. Orwell’s creation implies that—rather than some distant planet or people—the
        current unbalanced circumstances of the world are enough to throw society, in the span of one
        generation, into tragedy. Orwell displays a profound cynicism about the ability for the individual
        heart--its spirit of love and freedom--to survive against oppressive indoctrination. Although our
        democratic ideology may appear to immunize us against totalitarian control, one need only cast a
        casual glance at modern efforts to defeat terrorism by circumventing civil liberties to see how
        governments convince us to sacrifice freedom for security. Those efforts, along with the
        overwhelming presence of surveillance tools, manipulation of language, and our rapid
        acceptance of technology, reveal a society ripe for exploitation by a less just political leadership</p>
